"""Build benchmark cards from SciPost candidates and their arXiv source pairs.

Each card pairs an excerpt of the manuscript the referees actually read with
the referee's own statement of what is wrong.  The two sides are written to
separate files: only the model-facing file may ever be shown to an evaluated
model, and keeping the gold evidence in a different file makes that a property
of the layout rather than of a convention someone has to remember.

Localization anchors on the source diff rather than on LaTeX equation
numbering.  Equation numbers are assigned at typesetting time, so resolving
"Eq. (20)" against the source means replaying LaTeX's counters -- accurate
until it silently is not.  Anchoring instead on what the authors changed uses
two independent signals, the referee's complaint and the authors' edit, and
requires the authors to have actually acted.  Cards that cannot be anchored
are still emitted, marked unresolved, with every candidate hunk attached: a
referee may be right about a paper whose authors rebutted them.
